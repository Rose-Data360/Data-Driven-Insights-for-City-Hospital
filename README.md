## PROJECT OVERVIEW
#### City Hospital is a highly respected medical institution serving a diverse community. Despite its strong reputation, the hospital historically relied on intuition and historical patterns for operational and financial decisions. Recognizing the increasing importance of data in healthcare, hospital leadership sought to modernize its decision-making process through analytics.This project was initiated to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a centralized view of the hospital’s financial and operational performance. This dashboard was designed to uncover insights that support more efficient resource allocation and strategic planning by leveraging transactional data, including revenue, expenses, procedures, and demographic information.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
#### City Hospital lacked a centralised perspective of their financial performance. This made it challenging to recognise patterns, allocate resources, and make data-driven decisions
## AIM OF THE PROJECT
#### The primary objective of this project was to:

Design and develop a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends related to hospital operations.

Provide actionable insights that empower hospital leadership to make informed, data-backed decisions.

Enhance financial transparency, improve resource management, and increase operational efficiency across departments.
