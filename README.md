## PROJECT OVERVIEW
#### City Hospital is a highly respected medical institution serving a diverse community. Despite its strong reputation, the hospital historically relied on intuition and historical patterns for operational and financial decisions. Recognizing the increasing importance of data in healthcare, hospital leadership sought to modernize its decision-making process through analytics.This project was initiated to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a centralized view of the hospital’s financial and operational performance. This dashboard was designed to uncover insights that support more efficient resource allocation and strategic planning by leveraging transactional data, including revenue, expenses, procedures, and demographic information.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
#### City Hospital lacked a centralised perspective of their financial performance. This made it challenging to recognise patterns, allocate resources, and make data-driven decisions
## AIM OF THE PROJECT
#### The primary objective of this project was to:

Design and develop a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends related to hospital operations.

Provide actionable insights that empower hospital leadership to make informed, data-backed decisions.

Enhance financial transparency, improve resource management, and increase operational efficiency across departments.

## METHODOLOGY
### Data Cleaning and Integration
This process involves identifying and correcting
inconsistencies, missing/null values, and
duplicates within the data set. 

### Data Modeling
This involve establishing a logical structure for the
hospital’s data. The model defined the relationships
between different data points, allowing for efficient
querying and analysis.

### DAX Calculation and Dashboard Building
DAX calculations were created to Analyze Key
performance Indicators (KPIs). The dashboard will
provide real insights into the hospital’s performance.

## MODELLING
The data modeling for this project follows a star schema approach, where the Fact Table (containing hospital transactions) is connected to multiple Dimension Tables ( Doctors, Patients, Procedures, Locations, and Calendar) to ensure efficient analysis. 
By establishing correct one-to-many relationships, I ensured KPIs could be easily analyzed across specialties, locations, and periods, providing a flexible and powerful analytical basis and actionable insights for hospital management.

  ### Data Analysis
  Line Chart

  - The chart depicts quarterly patient visits during a three-year period. Visits remained constant at 18 per quarter until 2021, peaked at 36 in Q4 2022, and dropped significantly to 8 in Q3 2023. This pattern predicts a considerable increase in patient participation in 2022, followed by a steep drop in 2023, showing that operational or external issues influence patient turnout.

  - Revenue increased steadily from $21K in Q1 2021 to a high of $44K in Q4 2022, indicating solid business performance. However, a substantial reduction occurred in 2023, decreasing to $9K by the third quarter, indicating a major slump that may necessitate more inquiry into market or operational issues.

Bar Chart

- Dermatology ($39K) and Radiology ($37K) are the highest revenue-generating categories, followed closely by Paediatrics and Orthopaedics. General Medicine and Dentistry provided the least, at $21K and $22K, respectively. This distribution demonstrates a higher financial performance in specialised care services.

- Dermatologists generated the highest revenue at $68, indicating strong specialized skin care services performance.
 Cardiologists and Neurologists followed closely with $61K and $59K, highlighting their significant roles in high-revenue medical care.
 In contrast, Pediatricians earned the lowest at $24K, suggesting less revenue generation in child healthcare services.
