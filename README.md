## PROJECT OVERVIEW
#### City Hospital is a highly respected medical institution serving a diverse community. Despite its strong reputation, the hospital historically relied on intuition and historical patterns for operational and financial decisions. Recognizing the increasing importance of data in healthcare, hospital leadership sought to modernize its decision-making process through analytics.This project was initiated to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a centralized view of the hospital’s financial and operational performance. This dashboard was designed to uncover insights that support more efficient resource allocation and strategic planning by leveraging transactional data, including revenue, expenses, procedures, and demographic information.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
#### City Hospital lacked a centralised perspective of their financial performance. This made it challenging to recognise patterns, allocate resources, and make data-driven decisions
## AIM OF THE PROJECT
#### The primary objective of this project was to:

Design and develop a Power BI dashboard that visualizes key metrics and trends related to hospital operations.

Provide actionable insights that empower hospital leadership to make informed, data-backed decisions.

Enhance financial transparency, improve resource management, and increase operational efficiency across departments.

## METHODOLOGY
### Data Cleaning and Integration
This process involves identifying and correcting
inconsistencies, missing/null values, and
duplicates within the data set. 

### Data Modeling
This involve establishing a logical structure for the
hospital’s data. The model defined the relationships
between different data points, allowing for efficient
querying and analysis.

### DAX Calculation and Dashboard Building
DAX calculations were created to Analyze Key
performance Indicators (KPIs). The dashboard will
provide real insights into the hospital’s performance.

## MODELLING
The data modeling for this project follows a star schema approach, where the Fact Table (containing hospital transactions) is connected to multiple Dimension Tables ( Doctors, Patients, Procedures, Locations, and Calendar) to ensure efficient analysis. 
By establishing correct one-to-many relationships, I ensured KPIs could be easily analyzed across specialties, locations, and periods, providing a flexible and powerful analytical basis and actionable insights for hospital management.
