## PROJECT OVERVIEW
#### City Hospital is a highly respected medical institution serving a diverse community. Despite its strong reputation, the hospital historically relied on intuition and historical patterns for operational and financial decisions. Recognizing the increasing importance of data in healthcare, hospital leadership sought to modernize its decision-making process through analytics.This project was initiated to develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a centralized view of the hospital’s financial and operational performance. This dashboard was designed to uncover insights that support more efficient resource allocation and strategic planning by leveraging transactional data, including revenue, expenses, procedures, and demographic information.
